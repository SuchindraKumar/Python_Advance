Python's @property decorator is used to specify properties, which may then be accessed using the standard dot notation.\n",

    "#### __getattr__ vs. __getattribute__:compare getattr with getattribute: When an attribute on an object is accessed, both of these methods are invoked, but they serve distinct purposes. Only when an attribute cannot be located in the typical locations (such as the object's dict, class hierarchy, or any other descriptors related to it) is getattr called. In contrast, regardless of whether an attribute is used or not, getattribute is called each time. In contrast to getattr, which can only be used to define new attributes, getattribute may be used to modify the behaviour of built-in attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Properties vs. descriptors:Both properties and descriptors are used to restrict access to object attributes, although their functionality and degree of flexibility vary. A calculated attribute may be defined simply using a property, and getters and setters for private instance variables are frequently provided via properties. Descriptors, on the other hand, are more powerful and versatile than attributes. Not only instance variables but any sort of attribute may be controlled by them. Moreover, they may be used to create more sophisticated features like data validation, sluggish evaluation, and caching."
