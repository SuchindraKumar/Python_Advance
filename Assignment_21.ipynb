    "#### Ans. A mathematical function known as a probability distribution expresses the chance of various outcomes in a random event. It represents, in other words, the likelihood that a random variable may have distinct values or outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete and continuous probability distributions may be divided into two categories. A discrete probability distribution is one in which the potential outcomes of a random variable, such as the number of heads that may be received from a coin flip, are discrete and countable. Contrarily, a continuous probability distribution is one in which the range of potential values for a random variable, such as the amount of time it takes a student to finish an exam, is continuous and uncountable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probabilistic density functions (PDFs) or cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), which statistically quantify the chance of occurring for each conceivable event, are frequently used to characterise probability distributions. These routines can be used to determine the likelihood that a random variable will take on a specific value or fall within a specific range.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Even if the values of a probability distribution are random, the probability distribution function may be used to estimate the chance of specific events. Rather of describing the exact value that will be attained, probability distributions instead represent the likelihood that a result will occur. We can forecast the chances of specific occurrences occurring by calculating the probabilities of various outcomes."

    "#### On the other hand, pseudo-random numbers are created using deterministic algorithms that employ a seed value as an input. These algorithms result in a series of integers that seem random but are actually entirely predetermined by the algorithm's initial seed value. As a result, although appearing random, pseudo-random numbers are entirely deterministic and predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Although not being completely random, pseudo-random numbers are nonetheless regarded as \"good enough\" for many applications, including simulations, encryption, and scientific research. This is so that numbers may be produced by pseudo-random number generators that have statistical characteristics like uniformity and independence that are comparable to those of really random sequences. Additionally, even if the technique and seed value are known, current pseudo-random number generators are made to be incredibly unexpected and challenging to anticipate.\n",

As a result, pseudo-random numbers are often employed for a variety of applications and are seen to be \"good enough\" in many situations."
