    "#### Ans. Increasing the comparison between several figures on the same graph can be done in a number of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using various colours: Using distinct colours for each figure is one technique to improve comparisons between them. This may be accomplished by utilising the colour option in matplotlib to define a distinct colour for each plot.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Ans. Yeah, I can describe why compound interest is preferable to a higher rate of interest that does not compound. The interest computed on the principle amount and the total interest from prior periods is known as compound interest. In other words, interest is computed on the new total after the principle and interest generated during each period have been added. This implies that interest accrued throughout each period grows over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### If the interest rate does not compound, on the other hand, the interest received during each period is solely computed on the principal sum. The interest earned throughout each period is therefore fixed and does not rise over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The total amount of interest collected over time will be smaller in a non-compounding scenario than it would be in a compounding one, even though the interest rate may be higher. The total interest collected might rise over time due to the compounding impact of compound interest, increasing the overall return on investment."
