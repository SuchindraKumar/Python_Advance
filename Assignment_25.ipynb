    "#### Ans. A 180-day moving average is a technical analysis indicator used to examine trends in financial markets, notably in equities or indexes. It is determined by averaging the closing prices of a securities over the previous 180 days (or any other specified time period). The reason the moving average is referred to as \"moving\" is that it is computed on a daily basis, which means that each day, the oldest price in the calculation is subtracted and the most recent price is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A common indicator is the 180-day moving average since it may be used to smooth out short-term market swings and show the underlying trend more clearly. A security is often regarded to be in an uptrend when its current price is higher than its 180-day moving average, and in a downtrend when its price is lower.\n",
