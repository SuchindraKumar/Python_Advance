    "#### An abstract superclass is a class used in object-oriented programming that is solely meant to be used as a basis or template for other classes and not to be created directly. It provides a common interface and behaviour that its subclasses can inherit and extend, acting as a generalisation of those subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An abstract superclass does not give a full implementation of the methods or properties it declares, but subclasses are required to implement or override them. As a result, the superclass's behaviour may be modified by the subclasses to suit their particular requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While building a hierarchy of related classes, abstract superclasses are helpful since they describe common behaviour and properties while the subclasses give specialised implementations for various use cases. This can make the code more modular and simpler to maintain, as well as eliminate duplication of code and boost code reusability.\n",
