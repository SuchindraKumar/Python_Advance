The 128 characters of the ASCII character set, which are encoded using 7 bits, comprise letters, numbers, and symbols. On the other hand, the Unicode character set, which is encoded using up to 32 bits, has nearly 143,000 characters from scripts and languages all over the globe, including ASCII characters.\n",

As a result, it is feasible to express text in a broad range of languages and scripts using Unicode encoding while yet keeping traditional ASCII-encoded text compatible.."

    "#### Syntax changes: Syntax alterations When writing string literals in Python 2.X, you might use single quotes, double quotes, or the b prefix to denote byte string literals. In Python 3.X, byte string literals are written using the b prefix followed by the quotations, whereas Unicode string literals are written using single or double quotes. This implies that you might want to change your string literals and, where necessary, use the b prefix.\n",

This involves making sure your input data is correctly encoded and your output data is properly decoded, for example.
