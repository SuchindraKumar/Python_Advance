    "#### Ans. In October 2019, Python 3.8 was released, bringing with it a number of updates and new features. The following are a few of the Python 3.8's major new features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.This new syntax for doing assignments inside of expressions using the := operator is known as assignment expressions (The Walrus Operator). In some circumstances, it enables more terse and understandable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. This new syntax is used to define function arguments that can only be given by position, not by keyword. Functions may become more user-friendly and intuitive as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Debugging-friendly string representations of objects can be printed using the = operator with the help of the f-strings Support = (Debugging-friendly String Representations) enhancement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Python 3.8 included a number of enhancements to the typing module, including the addition of the TypedDict type and enhanced support for literals and protocols.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5.Speed enhancements: Python 3.8 comes with a number of performance enhancements, such as quicker function calls, quicker dictionary searches, and quicker list sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6.Additional enhancements: Python 3.8 comes with a number of new functions and enhancements, such as enhanced asyncio support, enhanced traceback handling, and enhanced support for Unix signals."
