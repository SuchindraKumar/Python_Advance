    "#### Ans. A metaclass in Python is a class that specifies how other classes behave. A metaclass, then, is a class that generates additional classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Python, every class is an instance of a metaclass. The type metaclass is the default for a class. To alter the behaviour of the classes we design, however, we may define our own metaclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The behaviour of classes can be added to or changed using metaclasses. For instance, we might use a metaclass to add a certain function to every class that uses that metaclass. A metaclass can also be used to enforce restrictions on classes, such as mandating a specific type or format for all of the class's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The creation of a domain-specific language (DSL) for a particular issue domain is the most frequent application of metaclasses. A metaclass is used, for instance, by Django's ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework to define models in its ORM. For each model, the metaclass builds a database table and assigns columns to each model's characteristics.\n",

    "#### The functionality of existing methods can be changed by using class decorators to add or delete instance methods, attributes, or both. For instance, we might create a class decorator that wraps each method in a logging wrapper that records the parameters and return value for each method call. The wrapper is invoked when an instance method is called, and it then calls the underlying method and reports its actions.\n",

    "#### On the other side, metaclasses may be used to alter how instances are started or produced. As an illustration, we might design a metaclass that intercepts a class's new method and alters the parameters to produce a unique instance. Another option is to establish a metaclass that intercepts a class's init function and executes some additional initialization operations either before or after the instance is generated."
