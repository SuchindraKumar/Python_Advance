    "#### Ans. Computer files used to store data come in two varieties: text files and binary files. Human-readable characters, such as letters, numbers, and symbols, are encoded in text files using character encoding standards like ASCII or UTF-8. A simple text editor or word processor may be used to open and edit text files, and people can readily read and comprehend the data therein.In contrast, a binary file includes information that cannot be read by humans, including pictures, audio files, executable code, and other non-textual data. Large volumes of data are frequently stored as binary files, which are handled by applications created to handle their particular format. Binary files need specific software or programming tools to be altered because they cannot be read or changed directly by humans. Due to the nature of the data they contain, binary files are often bigger than text files and require distinct handling and storing techniques."

    "#### Ans. The fact that the byte order (endianness) may differ from the byte order utilised by the machine reading the file is one of the key problems with utilising binary operations to read and write a Python integer straight to disc. The integer value could be misinterpreted, for instance, if a file is written on a system that uses little-endian byte order and is subsequently read on a system that uses big-endian byte order. Also, the integer's size (measured in bytes) may differ between platforms, which may impact compatibility. Another problem is that working with the data in the file might be challenging since binary operations might not be human-readable. As a result, using a higher-level file is frequently advised.such as CSV or JSON, to store data in a portable and human-readable format."

    "#### Ans. When opening a file in Python, the with keyword has the benefit of immediately shutting the file when all actions have been finished. When the context in which the file was opened is ended, the with statement immediately shuts the file, regardless of whether an error occurred. By doing so, frequent programming errors like failing to end a file—which can result in file corruption or data loss—are avoided. Also, because the code for opening and shutting the file is contained within a single block, utilising the with keyword helps make code more condensed and legible."

    "#### Ans. No matter what sequence the contents in a file is in, random-access file operations provide access to any portion of a file at any time. The seek() function in Python supports random-access operation. The parameter for this function defines the byte offset from the file's start to seek to. The read() function can be used to read data from a specific position in the file once the file pointer has been relocated there using seek(). Data may also be written to that spot in the file using the write() function. You are able to do random-access operations on a file by combining these techniques."

    "#### Ans. In Python, binary data is translated into packed binary data and vice versa using the struct package. It may be used to interact with low-level C programmes, operate with network protocols, and read and write binary files. When working with binary data that has a specified structure, such as a file format that contains a header followed by data fields of particular kinds and sizes, it is very helpful. The struct package offers a mechanism to both pack Python data into the proper binary format for writing to a file or transferring over a network, as well as a way to unpack the binary data into a format that can be readily modified in Python.\n",

You may use it to serialise items into a small binary form, which can then be deserialized and rebuilt into the original Python objects. This is helpful for developing caching methods, transferring data across Python- and other-language-written programmes, and maintaining the state of a running Python programme."

    "#### Ans. When you need to persistently store and retrieve Python objects but don't want to deal with the gritty details of opening, shutting, reading from, and writing to files, you may use the shelf package. It offers a high-level interface to a database-like system that enables string keys to be used for both storing and retrieving Python objects. On top of the pickle module, the shelf module enables you to store and retrieve Python objects in a dictionary-like fashion. Data persistence between programme runs, caching, and memoization are all possible uses for this. Thus, the shelf package is recommended for usage when you require a straightforward and practical method of storing and retrieving Python objects."

The requirement that the keys used to access the data be strings is a key constraint of utilising the shelf package.

A non-string key will automatically be transformed to a string using the str() method, which might not result in the desired outcomes."
